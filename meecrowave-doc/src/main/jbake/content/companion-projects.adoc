== Apache DeltaSpike

Apache DeltaSpike will cover several useful areas:

- Configuration
- Exception handling
- Advanced CDI utilities like partial bean binding (you define a bean behavior from a CDI handler implementation)
- Quartz integration
- Data/JPA integration (it is different than the Meecrowave one but depending your need can be useful)
- And much more

See http://deltaspike.apache.org/ for more information.

== Apache Sirona

Sirona aims to provide some monitoring capabilities (metrics on the runtime).
By default its servlet integration makes it smooth to integrate with Meecrowave.

See http://sirona.apache.org/ for more information.
